WARNING: [BD 41-1781] Updates have been made to one or more nets/interface connections marked for debug.
Debug nets, which are already connected to System ILA IP core in the block-design, will be automatically available for debug in Hardware Manager.
For unconnected Debug nets, please open synthesized design and use 'Set Up Debug' wizard to insert, modify or delete Debug Cores. Failure to do so could result in critical warnings and errors in the implementation flow.
CRITICAL WARNING: [BD 41-1343] Reset pin /gaussian_filter_0/ap_rst_n (associated clock /gaussian_filter_0/ap_clk) is connected to reset source /proc_sys_reset_25M/peripheral_aresetn (synchronous to clock source /clk_wiz_0/clk_out1).
This may prevent design from meeting timing. Please add Processor System Reset module to create a reset that is synchronous to the associated clock source /ov7670_axi_stream_ca_1/aclk.
WARNING: [BD 41-927] Following properties on pin /contatore_no_io_0/ap_clk have been updated from connected ip. They may not be synchronized with cell properties. You can set property on pin directly to confirm the value and resolve the warning.

WARNING: [BD 41-1781] Updates have been made to one or more nets/interface connections marked for debug.
Debug nets, which are already connected to System ILA IP core in the block-design, will be automatically available for debug in Hardware Manager.
For unconnected Debug nets, please open synthesized design and use 'Set Up Debug' wizard to insert, modify or delete Debug Cores. Failure to do so could result in critical warnings and errors in the implementation flow.

This may prevent design from meeting timing. Instead it should be connected to reset source /rst_design_1_100M/peripheral_aresetn.

Debug nets, which are already connected to System ILA IP core in the block-design, will be automatically available for debug in Hardware Manager.

Debug nets, which are already connected to System ILA IP core in the block-design, will be automatically available for debug in Hardware Manager.
For unconnected Debug nets, please open synthesized design and use 'Set Up Debug' wizard to insert, modify or delete Debug Cores. Failure to do so could result in critical warnings and errors in the implementation flow.

WARNING: [BD 41-1781] Updates have been made to one or more nets/interface connections marked for debug.
Debug nets, which are already connected to System ILA IP core in the block-design, will be automatically available for debug in Hardware Manager.
For unconnected Debug nets, please open synthesized design and use 'Set Up Debug' wizard to insert, modify or delete Debug Cores. Failure to do so could result in critical warnings and errors in the implementation flow.
CRITICAL WARNING: [BD 41-1344] Reset pin /gaussian_filter_0/ap_rst_n (associated clock /gaussian_filter_0/ap_clk) is connected to reset source /proc_sys_reset_25M/peripheral_aresetn (synchronous to clock source /clk_wiz_0/clk_out1).
This may prevent design from meeting timing. Instead it should be connected to reset source /rst_design_1_100M/peripheral_aresetn.
INFO: [xilinx.com:ip:axi_vdma:6.3-15] /axi_vdma_0 
                    All clocks connected to AXI VDMA are not identical, therefore configuring AXI-VDMA in ASYNC mode.
WARNING: [xilinx.com:ip:axi_vdma:6.3-155] /axi_vdma_0 
                    To get the better performance, ensure AXI Memory Map clock frequency is greater than equal to AXI Streaming clock frequency.
WARNING: [BD 41-927] Following properties on pin /contatore_no_io_0/ap_clk have been updated from connected ip. They may not be synchronized with cell properties. You can set property on pin directly to confirm the value and resolve the warning.

CRITICAL WARNING: [BD 41-759] The input pins (listed below) are either not connected or do not have a source port, and they don't have a tie-off specified. These pins are tied-off to all 0's to avoid error in Implementation flow.
Please check your design and connect them as needed:
